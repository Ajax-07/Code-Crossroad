Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.

Example:

Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
x = 2

Output: True

Explanation: In above test case N = 3.
The linked list with nodes N = 3 is
given. Then value of x=2 is given which
means last node is connected with xth
node of linked list. Therefore, there
exists a loop.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
1 <= Data on Node <= 103
